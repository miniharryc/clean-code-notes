# Clean Code

## Chapter 4: Comments

p. 54 "The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code...*FAILURE*...their use is not a cause for celebration."

"Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression."

"...because they LIE."

"Innacurate comments are fare worse than no comments at all."

Good Comments

- Legal Comments
- Informative Comments
- Explanations of intent
- Clarification
- Warnings of Consequences
- TODO comments <-- not allowed on our team
- Amplification <-- emphasize wsomethign really important
- JavaDoc in public apis

Bad Comments

- Mumbling: Unclear what you're talking about
- Redundant comments: Restate what the code (clearly) says
- Misleading comments
- Mandated Comments 
- Journal Comments -> this is what your VCS is for!
- Noise comments: Venting
- In place of a function or a varialbe
- Banners/Positions in a file
- Closing brace comments (matching markers)
- Bylines -> use VCS and `git blame`
- Commented-out code
- HTML comments
- non-local information (gets out of sync)
- Too much information -> Reference the canonical source
- inobvious connection: 
- function headers (short functions don't need them)
- javadocs in non-public code

## Chapter 5: Formatting

p. 76 "[Code formatting] is too important to ignore and it's too important to treat religiously."

### Vertical formatting: 

"Small files are ususally easier to understand than large files are."
- Fitnesse: 200 lines.  Upper limit of 500
- Newspaper metaphor: Upper -> high-level concepts, lower level details at the end

Concepts:
- Each group of lines represents a complete thought.  Separate with blank lines
- Vertical density implies close association.  Keep related concepts together.
- Instance variables @ top of class (Java-ism)
- caller should be above the callee

### Horizontal Formatting

"You should never have to scroll right...but monitors are too big for that nowadays"

"I personally set my limit at 120"

Use Horizontal whitespace to associate things that are strongly related.

### Summary
- Spaces around assignment operators
- No spaces between function names and parentheses
- Space after comman in function arguments

### Horizontal Alignment
"This sort of alignment is not useful"

### Indentation
- Don't break scheme for "one liners"
- programmers rely on indentation quite a bit.
- "One-liner loops", put the semicolon on the next line
   - Actually, just **never do this**

## Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures

"Expose abstract interfaces that allow users to implement the essence of the data without knowing its implementation."
  - Expose data in abstract terms

### Dichotomy of objects and Data Strucutures

Contrast:  
- **Objects**: hide data behind abstractions and expose functions to operate on the data.  Makes it hard to add new functions, easy to add classes
- **Data Structures**: expose data, have no functions.  Procedural code makes it easy to add functions, hard to add new data structures

### The Law of Demeter

More precisely, the Law of Demeter says that a method f of a class C should only call the methods of these:
- C
- An object created by f
- An object passed as an argument to f
- An object held in an instance variable of C


#### Train Wrecks

`final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsolutePath();`

Note: Demeter does not apply to data structures, just to objects.

### Beans are evil

"Just use `struct`," he says.
