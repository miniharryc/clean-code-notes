# Clean Code

## Chapter 4: Comments

p. 54 "The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code...*FAILURE*...their use is not a cause for celebration."

"Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression."

"...because they LIE."

"Innacurate comments are fare worse than no comments at all."

Good Comments

- Legal Comments
- Informative Comments
- Explanations of intent
- Clarification
- Warnings of Consequences
- TODO comments <-- not allowed on our team
- Amplification <-- emphasize wsomethign really important
- JavaDoc in public apis

Bad Comments

- Mumbling: Unclear what you're talking about
- Redundant comments: Restate what the code (clearly) says
- Misleading comments
- Mandated Comments 
- Journal Comments -> this is what your VCS is for!
- Noise comments: Venting
- In place of a function or a varialbe
- Banners/Positions in a file
- Closing brace comments (matching markers)
- Bylines -> use VCS and `git blame`
- Commented-out code
- HTML comments
- non-local information (gets out of sync)
- Too much information -> Reference the canonical source
- inobvious connection: 
- function headers (short functions don't need them)
- javadocs in non-public code

## Chapter 5: Formatting

p. 76 "[Code formatting] is too important to ignore and it's too important to treeat religiously."

## Vertical formatting: Small files are ususally easier to udnerstand than large files are.
- Fitnesse: 200 lines.  Upper limit of 500
- Newspaper metaphor: Upper -> high-level concepts, lower level details at the end

Concepts:
- Each group of lines represents a complete thought.  Separate with blank lines
- Vertical density implies close association.  Keep related concepts together.
- Instance variables @ top of class (Java-ism)
- caller should be above the callee
